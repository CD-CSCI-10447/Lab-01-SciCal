# Scientific Calculator Lab

## Introduction

Welcome to the Scientific Calculator Lab! In this exercise, you'll be developing functionalities for a scientific calculator. This will test your understanding of Java and provide hands-on experience with implementing mathematical operations. But there's a twist! You'll need to ensure that your methods are working correctly by creating and running unit tests.

## Prerequisites

- Java SDK installed
- Familiarity with basic mathematical operations
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
- A basic understanding of JUnit testing (JUnit5 is recommended)

## Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the lab repository to your local machine. This repository contains a starter code for the `ScientificCalculator` class and its unit tests.

2. **Open the Project**:
   Open the cloned project in your preferred IDE.

3. **Implement the Calculator**:
   Navigate to the `ScientificCalculator` class. Here, you'll find a number of methods with placeholders and comments. Your task is to complete each method according to its comment.

4. **Testing**:
   After implementing a method in the `ScientificCalculator` class, navigate to the associated unit test. Run the test to verify that your method is working correctly.

   For example, after completing the `add` method, run the `testAdd` method in the `ScientificCalculatorTest` class to ensure that your implementation of addition is correct.

   It's crucial to test after implementing each method to ensure that each function works correctly and independently of the others.

5. **Handle Edge Cases**:
   Pay close attention to the comments within each method. Some methods require handling specific scenarios (like division by zero). Make sure your methods are robust enough to handle these edge cases without crashing.

6. **Refactor**:
   After passing a test, take a moment to look at your code. Can you make it more efficient or readable? Refactoring is an essential step in the development process. It ensures that your code is not only functional but also clean and maintainable.

7. **Complete All Methods**:
   Work your way through all the methods in the `ScientificCalculator` class, ensuring each one is implemented and passes its associated test.

8. **Submission**:
   Once all methods are implemented and all tests pass, commit and push your changes to the repository. This will be your submission for the lab.

## Tips

- **Use Java's Math Library**: The Java standard library has a `Math` class with many useful methods. This can be especially handy for trigonometric functions.

- **Read Error Messages**: If a test fails, read the error message thoroughly. It will often provide clues about what's wrong with your implementation.

- **Ask for Help**: If you're stuck on a particular method or test, don't hesitate to ask your peers or instructor for help.

## Conclusion

By the end of this lab, you should have a working scientific calculator and corresponding tests to verify its accuracy. This lab emphasizes the importance of testing in software development. A working program is great, but a well-tested program ensures reliability and robustness. Good luck, and happy coding!
